# Dicee-Challenge

The **Dicee-Challenge** repository is a web development project that presents an exciting challenge focused on creating an interactive dice game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The repository offers a hands-on learning experience for beginners and intermediate developers interested in sharpening their front-end development skills.

Within this repository, you will find a well-structured codebase that guides you through the process of building a dynamic web page. The project revolves around simulating a dice rolling game where two dice are displayed on the screen, and upon refreshing the page, their values change randomly.

The **Dicee-Challenge** repository provides a comprehensive set of resources, including HTML templates, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript scripts. The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the page, while the CSS file defines the visual appearance and layout. The JavaScript code adds interactivity and functionality to the dice game, allowing the user to roll the dice with a click of a button or by refreshing the page.

By exploring this repository and engaging with the code, you will gain valuable insights into front-end web development principles, such as manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), handling events, and generating random numbers. Additionally, the project encourages you to experiment and customize the game further, expanding your creativity and problem-solving skills.

Whether you are an aspiring web developer looking to strengthen your fundamentals or an experienced coder seeking a fun challenge, the **Dicee-Challenge** repository offers an engaging learning opportunity. Get ready to roll the dice and enhance your web development skills by diving into this interactive project.
